# Meriskill_Sales_Analysis
# Introduction
The corporate world lives on data-driven choices, therefore the ability to harness the power of data is critical. In this project, we will go on an interesting trip to analyse sales data, identify trends, and get useful insights that will guide strategic decision-making.

Our major aim is to extract meaningful information from a huge sales dataset, giving a path for optimising sales methods and attaining long-term growth
# Problem
The primary problem is to gain insights into sales trends and patterns, identify the best_selling products, understand regional variations, and extract actionable insights to optimize sales strategies.
# Purpose
Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for 
business decision-making
# Description
In this project, we will dig through a massive sales dataset to uncover useful insights. We will analyse sales patterns over time, discover top-selling products, compute revenue indicators like total sales and profit margins, and design visuals to effectively explain our results. This project demonstrates our ability to analyse massive datasets and provide data-driven recommendations for optimising sales methods.

But we won't simply stop with data; we will bring these insights to life through appealing visualisations that resonate with stakeholders.

# Business Task
Q1. What is the overall sales trend?

Q2. What are the products performance by revenue?

Q3. What are the Products performance by Quantity?

Q4. What is the Order performance per City?

# Tools Used
Microsoft Excel for cleaning and exploring data, Microsoft BI for visualization and analysis.
# Steps
Data Import: I imported and processed raw data from CSV files into Microsoft Excel.

Data Cleaning: I cleaned the data to verify its correctness and consistency, which included standardising formats and fixing mistakes.

Data Transformation: I converted the data to make it ready for analysis. This transformation consists of computations, aggregation, and filtering processes. In addition, I used Microsoft Excel to generate new columns for the analysis.

Data Visualisation: Data Visualisation: I used Microsoft Power BI's charts and graphs to visually represent the analysed data. I also designed a dashboard based on the insights gained from the analysed data.
